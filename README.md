# Alzheimer's Disease Citation Network 
Code for analyzing a citation network of papers related to Alzheimer's Disease. Project for the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center during the summer of 2017. A PDF of our methodology and results is included along with the R code we used to do our analysis. 

## Usage
In order to get the topic for each paper, you will need to leave the R script and use Topic Mapping. 
The source code and a nice tutorial for Topic Mapping can be found here: https://amaral.northwestern.edu/resources/software/topic-mapping.
